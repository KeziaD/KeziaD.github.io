                        <h2>Hey, welcome in my creative space!</h2>
                        <p>This is me Kezia, the founder of KEZIA.

                            Nice to meet you! 
                            
                            Let me introduce myself quickly. I am a Berlin local and as I grew up in this vibrant city, I started to explore my creativity at a super young age.

                            Therefore I experiend with different materials and methods, such as painting and drawing, sewing, making pottery, photography and even developing different creative concepts.
                        
                            Everything around me either people, nature, architecture, art or fashion inspires me to create and is the fuel that drives me forward every day.

                            Right now I'm studying communication design at FH Potsdam, where I am evolving and developing my creative view and work constantly.

                            Based on this I had the chance to build my experience daily and support you to make your ideas come to life!

                            Happy to connect with you! 

                            Kind regards,

                            Kezia
